Assignment 1: This program is designed to implement stacks and queues using a class template names SimpleList.
The SimpleList template models a singly linked list with push() and pop() capabilities.  The user 
is asked for the name of a text file to be parsed and the desired name of an output file to which 
the program will send its output.  The output of the program describes all of the operations 
carried out, in a very specific manner.

Assignment 2: This program takes in a list with 4 columns and sorts the list according to a user input.  The sorts implemented include Insertion Sort, Radix Sort, Bin Sort, and Counting Sort.  All sorting methods were compared to the built in sort() function.
